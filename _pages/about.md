This is Yudu Li. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. Zhi-Pei Liang. Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on developing computational methodologies for biomedical imaging, with the emphasis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). I have been developing novel mathemtical models and computational methods for MR-based metabolic imaging, quantitative imaging, and multimodal neuroimaging methods. Specifically, I am building powerful computational frameworks that synergistically integrates spin physics, signal modelling, statistical inference, and advance machine learning to overcome the challenges in high-dimensional imaging problems and push the performance limits of modern MR systems.
